# DSC180A_A08_Methodology7


This repository contains the completed codes for this project that focuses on multiple testing. The src folder contains the main R scripts, with all the functions inside, and the data folder, where all the datasets are held. 

In the reference folder, it contains the two papers written by Prof.Schwartzman, which are also the ones we will replicate. In the markdown folder, it has our introduction part of the report.

The function will return the t statistic, p values and various plots that show the differences between the theoretical null model and the empirical null model. 

The congfig folder contains three json files for the use of functions' parameters. 

The test folder contains the data sample and a folder to store the output of the functions.
To run the functions.R file, please use the run.R .

Additionally, we created a new run.py that will be used to run run.R
